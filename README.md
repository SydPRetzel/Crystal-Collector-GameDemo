# The Crystal Collector Game
This is the implementation of the Crystal Collector Game.

The computer generates a random number between 19 and 120.  Each of the four crystals is assigned a random number between 1 and 12.  The user accummulates their score by selecting each crystal.  If the user score reaches the computer generated number exactly, the user wins.  If the user score exceeds the computer number, the user loses.

Upon win or lose, a new game is started automatically.
